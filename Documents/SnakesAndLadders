First clarify requirements and then object identification(objects that can be created)
Requirements       										|							Objects
a. How many dice?	   									<-							Dice
	i) 1 but should be scalable
b. How many snakes and ladders							<-							snakes and ladders
	i)should be able to dynamically define during				
	  setup time.					
c.	--   												<-							Board
d. Winning condition									<-							Players
	i) Any one wins game finished.
e. -- 													<-							Cells	 

Player object{
	String id;
	int currentPosition;
}

Dice{
	int diceCount;
	rollDice(){};
}

Snake{
	int start; 			-------------
	int end;						|
}									|
									|
Ladder{								----------- Can Create a common object which takes you from one cell to another(JUMP)	
	int start;						|
	int end;						|
}									|
						-------------
Jump{
	int start;
	int end;
}

Board{
	Cells[][];
}

Cell{
	Jump; 		//if the cell contains jump check and decide where to take the user.
}

Game{
	Board;
	Dice;
	Dequeue<Players> playerList; 
	//deque is taken because when a player plays his chance he is moved to the last and the player at 1st position plays his chance. 
}

Relationships:

1. Game 'has-a' Board , 'has-a' Dice, 'has-a' Player;
2. Board 'has-a' Cell;
3. Cell 'has-a' Jump;
